cab_xxxx files found in WINDOWS\TEMP folder

ans : 

we had the same problem. Deleting the cab_xxxx files only resulted in regeneration every 30min.
Checking <windows>\Logs\CBS folder I found lots of .log and (some) .cab files
It seems, that windows wasn't able to zip (makecab.exe) one of the .log files.
Solution was:
in <windows>\Logs\CBS folder delete the oldest .log file (you can also delete them all)
in <windows>\temp folder delete every cab_xxxx
in the following regeneration process, the remaining (CBS) logs where zipped correctly, and <windows>\temp was left clean
